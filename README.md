# Flask Mega Tutorial

This repo hosts my work from the awesome [Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world), by Miguel Grinberg. 

The tutorial walks you through creating a web app with Flask, including setting up and connecting to a backend via SQLAlchemy (with SQLite), integrating a `Redis Queue` for background jobs, and even containerizing the app and deploying with Docker.
